\begin{proof}
	Let $V,W$ be finite dimesional vector space over the smae field $\implies V$ is isomorphic to $W$ $\Leftrightarrow$ dim $(V)$ = dim$(W)$
	
	$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $V$ is isomorphic to $W$ and that $T:V \rightarrow W$ is an isomorphism
	
	$\because T$ is an isomorphism $\Leftrightarrow T$ is linear and $T$ is one-to-one and onto, $~\therefore$ By lemma of Thm 2.17 $T:V \rightarrow W$ is invertible $\implies$ dim($V$) = dim$(W)$
	
	$(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose dim$(V)$ = dim$(W)$. Let $\beta = \{v_i ~|~ \text{for } i = 1,\cdots,n\}$ be a order basis of $V$
	
	$\gamma = \{w_i ~|~ \text{for } i = 1,\cdots,n\}$ be a orderbasis of $W$
	
	$\because $ By Thm 2.6 $\therefore \exists T: V \rightarrow W$ is a linear transform $\ni T(v_i) = w_i$ for $i = 1 ,\cdots,n$
	
	$\because$ By Thm 2.2 $\therefore R(T) =$ span($T(\beta)$) = span$(\gamma) = W \implies T$ is onto.
	
	$\because$ By Thm 2.5 and dim($V$) = dim($W$) $\therefore T$ is one-to-one $\implies T$ is invertible $\implies T$ is an isomorphism $\implies V$ is isomorphic to $W$
\end{proof}
