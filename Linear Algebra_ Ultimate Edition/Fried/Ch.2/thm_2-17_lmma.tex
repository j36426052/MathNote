\begin{proof}
	Let linear transform $T:V\rightarrow W$ is invertible $\implies V$ is finite dimensional $\Leftrightarrow$ $W$ is finite dimensional
	
	In this case, dim($V$) = dim($W$) 
	
	$(\Rightarrow) V$ is finite dimension
	
	Let $\beta = \{ x_i ~|~ \text{for } i = 1,\cdots , n\}$ be a basis of $V$
	
	$\because$ Thm 2.2 $\therefore R(T) = $span($T(\beta)$), $\because T$ is invertible $\therefore R(T) = W$, $\because $ Thm 1.9 $\therefore W$ is finite dimensional
	
	$(\Leftarrow) W$ is finite dimensional. Similarly, $V$ is finite dimensional 
	
	Suppose $V,W$ are finite dimensional $\because T$ is invertible $\Leftrightarrow T$ is one-to-one and onto,~$\therefore $ nullity$(T) = 0 $
	
	$\because $By Thm 2.3 nullity$(T) + $ rank$(T) =$ dim($V$) $\therefore$ dim($V$) = rank $(T)$ = dim($R(T)$) = dim($W$)
\end{proof}
