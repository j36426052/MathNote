\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets in some metric space $X$, prove that they are separated.
	\item Prove the same of disjoint open sets.
	\item Fix $p \in X,\delta > 0$. Define
	$$A = \{q \in X ~|~ d(p,q) < \delta\}$$
	and 
	$$B = \{q \in X ~|~ d(p,q) > \delta\}$$
	Prove that $A$ and $B$ are separated
	\item Prove that every connected metric space with at least two points is uncountable.
