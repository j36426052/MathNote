Construct a bounded set of real numbers with exactly three limit points.

\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{solution}
		The idea come from the set $\{\dfrac{1}{n}~|~ n \in \N\}$
		
		In fact, $\forall x \in \R$, the set
		
		$$E = \{x + \dfrac{1}{n} ~|~ n \in \N\}$$
		
		has exactly one limit point, namely, $x$. Clearly, $x$ is a limit point of $E$. We prove that $E$ does not have any other limit point.
		
		Given $y \in \R$. If $y < x$ or $y \geq x + 1$, then  it is clear that $y$ cannot be limit point.
		
		If $x < y < x+1$, then we have two cases
	\end{solution}
