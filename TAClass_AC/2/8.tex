Let $X$ be a metric space and $E \subseteq X$

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that $E^{\circ}$ is always open.
	\item Prove that $E$ is open if and only if $E^{\circ} = E$
	\item If $G \subseteq E$ and $G$ is open, prove that $G \subseteq E$
	\item Prove that the complement of $E^{\circ}$ is the closure of the complement of $E$, i.e. $(E^{\circ})^c = \overline{E^c}$
	\item Do $E$ and $\overline{E}$ always have the same interiors?
	\item Do $E$ and $E^{\circ}$ always have the same closures?
\end{enumerate}
