Assume that $S \subseteq \R^n$. A point $x \in \R^n$ is said to be a condensation point of $S$ if every $r>0,~ B(x,r) \cap S$ is uncountable. Prove the following statements:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If for every $x \in S$, there is a $r_x > 0$ such that $B(x,r_x) \cap S$ is countable then $S$ is countable.
	\item If $S$ is not countable, then there exists a point $x \in S$ such that $x$ is a condensation point of $S$.
\end{enumerate}
