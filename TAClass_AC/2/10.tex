Suppose $z = a + ib,~w = c+di$. Define $z < w$ if $a<c$, and also if $a=c$ but $b<d$. Prove that this turns the set of all complex numbers into an ordered set. (This type of order relation is called a dictionary order, or lexicographic order, for obvious reasons) Does this ordered set have the least-upper-bound property?
