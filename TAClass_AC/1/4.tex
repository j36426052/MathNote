Let $E$ be a nonempty subset of an order set; suppose $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and $\beta$ is an upper bound of $E$. Prove that $\alpha \leq \beta$.

\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{solution}
		Suppose $\alpha$ is a non-empty subset of an order set. Suppose $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and $\beta$ is an upper bound of $E$. This means
		
		$$\alpha \leq x \text{ and } x \leq \beta \forall x \in E$$
		
		Since $E \neq \emptyset$, choose $x \in E$, then $\alpha \leq x$ and $x \leq \beta$. By transitivity, $\alpha \leq \beta$
	\end{solution}
