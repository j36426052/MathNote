\begin{proof}
	Suppose $W_{1} \cup W_{2}$ is a subspace of $V$, we assume that $W_{1} \nsubseteq W_{2}$ and $W_{2} \nsubseteq W_{1}$. Let $x \in W_{1} \backslash W_{2}$ $y \in W_{2} \backslash W_{1}$, then $x+y \in W_{1}$ or $W_{2}$, say $W_{1}$. But $y=(x+y)-x \in W_{1}$, which is a contradiction. So we have $W_{1} \subseteq W_{2}$ or $W_{2} \subseteq W_{1}$. Conversely is trivial.
