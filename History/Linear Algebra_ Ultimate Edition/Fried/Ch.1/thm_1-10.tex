\begin{proof}
	Let $dim(V)=n$. If $W=\{0\}$, then $W$ is finite-dimensional and $dim(W)=0 \leq n$. Otherwise, $W$ contains a nonzero vector $x_1$, so $\{_1\}$ is a linear independent set. We continue choosing vectors $x_1,...,x_k \in W$ such that ${x_1,...,x_k}$ is linear independent. This process must stop at $k \leq n$ and $\{x_1,...,x_k\}$ is linear independent and other vector in $W$ produces a linear dependent set. Hence it is a basis of $W$. Thus $dim(W)=k \leq n$. If $dim(W)=n$, a basis of $W$ is a linear independent subset of $V$ contains $n$ vectors, so a basis of $W$ is also a basis of $V$. Thus $W=V$.
