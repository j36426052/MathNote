$T$ is one-to-one $\iff N(T)= \{0\}$\\
$\Rightarrow$ \\
Suppose $T$ is one-to-one and $x \in N(T)$\\
$T(x) = 0 = T(0)$ \\
$\because T$ is one-to-one $\therefore x = 0$ \\
$\Rightarrow N(T) = \{0\}$ \\
$\Leftarrow$ \\
Suppose $N(T) = \{0\}$ and $T(x) = T(y)$ \\
$0 = T(x)- T(y) = T(x-y)$ \\
$\because N(T) = \{0\}$ $\therefore x-y = 0 \therefore x=y$ \\
$\Rightarrow T$ is one-to-one \\
$\Rightarrow T$ is one-to-one $\iff N(T)= \{0\}$
